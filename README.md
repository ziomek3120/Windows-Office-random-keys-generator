# Windows-Office-random-keys-generator
Generates random keys in Windows/Office format. If you're lucky, MAYBE one of the keys will work...


 By default, the program generates 10,000 files in the keys folder, each file contains 132 keys and the file size is similar to the disk allocation unit (4kb). The program is multi-threaded and uses all cores and threads to generate keys. The number of generated files and keys per file can be changed by editing the source code and compiling it. 


The process can be automated by writing a script that allows automatic entry of keys from the above-mentioned files, but I do not provide such a tool!!!
